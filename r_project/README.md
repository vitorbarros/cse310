# Overview

As a software engineer, I built this project to strengthen my data analysis workflow in R: loading real-world data, cleaning it, summarizing trends, and producing clear visualizations. The software ingests the Gapminder dataset, transforms it into analysis-ready structures, applies statistical modeling, and exports charts and a summary report.

I wrote this software to practice core R language features (vectors, data frames, functions, control flow), along with common data tooling (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`). It reflects a realistic analysis pipeline I can reuse for future projects.

# Development Environment

I developed this project with R and RStudio, using the terminal to run scripts with `Rscript`.

The project is written in R and uses the libraries `dplyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for visualization, and `readr` for fast CSV loading.

# Future Work

- Add more advanced statistical models (e.g., multiple regression with additional predictors).
- Build interactive visualizations with `plotly`.
- Expand the analysis to include regional clusters and outlier detection.
