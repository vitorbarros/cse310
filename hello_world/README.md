# Overview

This is my first Hello World

This software will print on the console the phrase "Hello World"

I am creating this software as a requirement of the class that I am taking at BYU-I

## Just for context: If anybody see this project on my profile, do not think I am a beginner. I have over 14 years of experience as a Software Engineer, so this is just for the class.
